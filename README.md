## How do I run it?

To run the backend and to run the frontend you must have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) installed and ideally [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

1. Run the command `pnpm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. You need to add the environment variables for the required external services:
  - [Stack Auth](https://stack-auth.com/)
  - [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/)
  - Look in `.env.example` for the required environment variables.
3. Run the command `pnpm run dev` to run the application in developer mode.
